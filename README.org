The source code for a demonstration of Magit in Emacs.  This uses the
[[https://github.com/howardabrams/demo-it][demo-it]] package for Emacs. (I'll post a link to an online recording shortly)

However, I would assume that most people would just want to run the
two Bash scripts to help create a complex Git repository where they
can play around with a real-feeling repository, and can destroy it to
try again.
